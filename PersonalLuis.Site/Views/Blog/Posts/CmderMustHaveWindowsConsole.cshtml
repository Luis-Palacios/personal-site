        Microsoft Build 2019 has just finished and some very exciting annuncements were
        made among some of them is the new Windows Terminal which is described as:
        <blockquote>a new, modern, fast, efficient, powerful, and productive terminal application for users of command-line tools and shells like Command Prompt, PowerShell, and WSL.</blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
        They even create a video that is quite the marketing effort and I have to addmited its looking sharp

        You can see the presentation at Microsoft Build here: <a target="_blank" href="https://mybuild.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/77004">Windows Terminal: Building a better command line experience for developers</a>
        and you can see more details on this blog post: <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/introducing-windows-terminal/" target="_blank">Introducing Windows Terminal</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Too little too late?</h2>
    <p>
        There is no doubt about too late because we know we haven't had a decent built-in terminal in windows, all we had is the Windows command prompt which
        is already ~30 years old and while it does it works it's not a tool where you want
        to spent your time in. The team working on it have added some basic features to it but is still a long way
        from most terminals specialy the ones aviable on UNIX systems and we certainily can not
        customized as it is posible on UNIX and if you have used something like <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/" target="_blank">oh my zsh</a>
        you will know cmd it just miles away from what that. Is it to little? We will know once it fully released.
    </p>
    <p>
        You also have Powershell as an option but is also not that great, why haven't this be a priority for Microsoft
        I'm not sure but in my opinion it might be related to the fact that for most of the time until recently
        Dotnet developer have been mostly using IDE(Visual Studio) for development and you normally had
        eveything you needed there, you would normally just need the console to quickly run a command once then close it.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Do we need a good console application on Windows?
    </h2>
    <p>
        As more and more CLI became popular with so many tools that exist now on Nodejs the need for a good console is evident
        even dotnet core has move to use more and more CLI tools and while you can integrate all of this directly
        into Visual Studio so that those scripts will be run along when you build or execute your Solution from Visual Studio.
        The truth is many people is shifting away from the big IDE experience and using more lightweights such as Visual Studio code and
        terminal commands and if you are doing Development in other languages such as python, javascript or ruby you cannot
        escape the need of a better console.
    </p>
    <p>
        Such was my case when I started doing Django development, coming mostly from a DotNet background I opted to stay
        on Windows to do Django development everything was going well except for cmd I was doing my pip installs , creating virtual enviroments,
        , generating and running migrations and even runing the application I needed to do that from the terminal and cmd was just not good enough.
        So I set myself to find a decent console for windows
    </p>
    <h2>Console options for Windows</h2>
    <p>
        If you do a google search for alternatives on windows you will find many options aviable for you, and one that you probably
        already have is you are a software developer is <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash" target="_blank">git bash</a>
        which is normally included on the <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/" target="_blank">Git installer for windows</a> and no doubt it' a great improvement
        it allows you to execute Unix style commands it also provide you with commands such as ssh, scp, cat, etc and
        in addition it has great auto-complete for git commands however there are a few things that are missing.
        <ol class="post-list">
            <li>
                1. Tabs and Split Views
            </li>
            <li>
                2. Better keyboard and shortcuts support
            </li>
            <li>
                3. Better looks and more customizable options
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        So what choices do we have? actually a lot since many people have feel the need of a better console application in windows, just to mention a few

    </p>
    <h2>
        My pick
    </h2>
    <p>
        I'm in a agreement with results in Slant since I also went for <a href="https://cmder.net/">cmder</a> -- pronounced “Commander”
        it provides exactly what I wanted, I really like the default styles and if you don't you can customize it, it also provides great
        split views and great keyboard shorcuts
    </p>

        <a href="https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/master/README.md">About cmder</a> but I will give you a very
        brief overview of some of features I use the most
    </p>
    <h3>Unix Style Commands</h3>
    These are actually a gift from git for windows and not cmder itself however cmder can take advantages of them and use them
    and if case you are new to the console world on windows I want you to be aware of the goodies aviable
    <ul class="post-list">
        <li>
            <strong>ls</strong> to list the folders and file nams in the current working diretory and you can actually use the <a href="https://www.techonthenet.com/unix/basic/ls.php">Variety of flags</a>
            <div class="thumb-wrap sub-image-wrap">
                <img src="/images/posts/cmder/ls.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="cmder-must-have-windows-console">
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>touch</strong> have you ever tried to create a <code>.someName</code> file on windows? it could be troblesome but you can use touch for quickly create empty files
            and update the modification date on existent files eg: <code>touch .editorconfig </code>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>cat</strong> to concatenate and quickly check the contents of a file directly on the console.
            <div class="thumb-wrap sub-image-wrap">
                <img src="/images/posts/cmder/cat.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="cmder-must-have-windows-console">
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>rm</strong> for deleting files and folder use it with <code>-r</code> to recursively delete subfolders and <code>-f</code>
            to force my most typical use for this is <code>rm -rf node_modules</code> &#128517;
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>ssh</strong>, <strong>ssh-keygen</strong> and <strong>ssh-add</strong> For accessing remote servers, the lack of using ssh
            as I was able to use it on linux is probably the biggest reason I have cursed Windows, having to deal with <a href="https://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a> and it's utilities
            was a nightmare to me in comparisson with using ssh on linux, and to my sorprise many people still think PuTTY is the only way to use ssh
            on windows, but we actually have two ways to use ssh just like on linux now, one that comes with git for windows an open ssh client that now
            comes built in on Windows 10 so Putty is no longer your only option if you need to ssh into a server. If you want to check which ones you have aviable you can
            use the <code>where</code> and <code>which</code> commands
            <div class="thumb-wrap sub-image-wrap">
                <img src="/images/posts/cmder/ssh.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="cmder-must-have-windows-console">
            </div>
            As you can see I have both options aviable but I'm using the open ssh client that comes in Windows 10
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Key board shorcuts</h3>
    <ul class="post-list">
        <li>
            <strong>Ctrl + t</strong> you are probably already familiar with this short cut since it's used to open a new tab on browsers and on cmder it does exactly the same
            so it is easy to get used to it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Ctrl + w</strong> close the current tab
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Alt + Enter</strong> Full screen
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Ctrl + Alt + u</strong> Same as typing <code>cd ..</code> and hitting enter on the console it allows you to quickly traverse up in the directory structure
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Ctrl + r</strong> Have you ever typed and execute and command with so many paramters that is hard to remember and you didn't save it? this shortcut have save me
            many times
            <div class="thumb-wrap sub-image-wrap">
                <img src="/images/posts/cmder/search.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="cmder-must-have-windows-console">
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Copy & Paste</h3>
    <ul class="post-list">
        <li>
            <strong>Copy</strong> just select/hightlight the text that you would like to copy and you have copied the selected text
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Paste</strong> you can simply right click to paste the text on the clipboard or use <code>Ctrl + shift + v</code>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Git</h3>
    <ul class="post-list">
        <li>
            <strong>Git auto complete</strong> Just type something like <code>git co</code> and hit tab and it will autocomple <code>git commit</code> for you it can even suggest commands for you
            when there is more than one auto-complete options try something like <code>git che</code> and you will see something like:
            <div class="thumb-wrap sub-image-wrap">
                <img src="/images/posts/cmder/gitchec.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="cmder-must-have-windows-console">
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Git info right there on the console</strong>
            <div class="thumb-wrap sub-image-wrap">
                <img src="/images/posts/cmder/git.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="cmder-must-have-windows-console">
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Aliases</h3>
    This is probably the feature I love the most because of much it increases my productivity and how simple it is to use it

    The following is a list of a few commands that I've used pretty much on daily basis
    <ul class="post-list">
        <li>
            <strong>python manage.py runserver</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>python manage.py makemigrations</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>python manage.py migrate</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>dotnet run</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>cd source/repos/somerepo</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>rm -rf node_module && npm install</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>git fetch && git checkout somebranch</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>git commit -m "my commit comment"</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You can see some of them are a bit long with Alias I can create shorthands for all of these and it's as simple as <code>alias djrun=python manage.py runserver</code>
        where djrun is the alias you would like to use for me is dj from django and run of running the server so now I can just type <code>djrun</code>  which it's a lot less typing
        than <code>python manage.py runserver</code> and I can do similar things for my other commands.
    </p>
